- **JavaScript Utilities**: Provide tools for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: 70.1% of the codebase, used for smart contract development.
- **JavaScript**: 29.9% of the codebase, used for utilities and interaction scripts.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Powered**: Implements decentralized token management.
- **Secure Infrastructure**: Designed with security best practices for handling e-commerce transactions.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Includes comprehensive tools and scripts for deployment and testing.

## Recent Updates
